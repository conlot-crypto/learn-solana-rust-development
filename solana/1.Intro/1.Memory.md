On a high level, memory inside a Solana cluster can be thought of as a monolithic heap of data.
Smart contracts on Solana ("programs") each have access to their own part of that heap

All state (SOL accounts, smart contracts, and memory used by smart contracts) lives in this heap.

And each memory region has a program that manages it (sometimes called the “owner”).

The solana term for a memory region is "account" and some programs own thousands of independent accounts

Accounts that store programs are owned by the `BPFLoader`. This is a program that can be used to deploy and upgrade other programs.

The `BPFLoader` is owned by the `Native Loader` and that is where the recursion ends.
