The System Program is a smart contract with some additional privileges.

All "normal" SOL accounts are owned by the System Program.

To provide transfer functionality, the system program has a `transfer` endpoint which takes 2 accounts - `from` and `to` with a `lamports` argument.

If the user passed in a from account that was not owned by the system program, the transaction would fail. Because a program may not write to any accounts that it doesn't own.

There's one exception to this rule though. If the to account was owned by a different program, the transaction would still succeed. This is because programs may increase the lamports of an account even if they do not own it.

Next to transferring lamports, the system program is used to create accounts for other programs. An account is created with a specific size and a specific amount of lamports. Let's now look at program composition to see how creating accounts works in practice.
