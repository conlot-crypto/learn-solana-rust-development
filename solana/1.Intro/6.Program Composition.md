There are two ways for developers to make programs interact with each other. To explain these, we'll use a common flow on Solana: Create & Initialize.

Consider a counter program with two endpoints. One to initialize the counter and one to increment it. To create a new counter, we call the system program's `create_account` to create the account in memory and then the counter's `initialize` function.

1. The first way to create and initialize the counter is by using multiple instructions in a transaction.

2. The second way is to use Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs). A CPI is a direct call from one program into another within the same instruction.

Anchor recommends CPIs to create and initialize accounts when possible (Accounts that are created by CPI can only be created with a maximum size of 10 kibibytes. This is large enough for most use cases though.). This is because creating an account inside your own instruction means that you can be certain about its properties. Any account that you don't create yourself is passed in by some other program or user that cannot be trusted.
